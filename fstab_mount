1. figure out which drive/partition you want to auto mount
sudo fdisk -l

2. find the uuid/type
sudo blkid

3. edit fstab
sudo nano /etc/fstab

	example:
	
	UUID=8A11-521D /media/MYUSBSTICK vfat defaults 0 0
	UUID=E8D6B339D6B3073A /media/NTFShare ntfs defaults 0 0
	UUID=d17b3219-a43d-4c38-b9cd-0ad892fa9d6e /media/Bankai ext4 defaults 0 0
	
	If you are running on a single user machine, you may like to own the file system yourself and grant all possible permissions:
	/dev/NTFS-partition  /mnt/windows  ntfs-3g   uid=username,gid=users    0       0

hit Ctrl+o, Enter, Ctrl+x to save and quit

4. Done!! reboot and test if it works.

NOTE: If dualbooting disable Fast Startup and Hibernation in Windows.
 
cmd Run as administrator
powercfg /h off
How to get it back ?
powercfg /h on
How to know if it is disabled ?
go to ‘Control Panel’ -> ‘Hardware and Sound’ -> ‘Power Options’ -> ‘Change what power buttons do’, options page.

In this page, under the ‘Shutdown settings’ section at the bottom, you will only see two options listed (‘Sleep’ & ‘Lock’), where previously it had two more options called: ‘Turn on fast start-up (recommended)’ and ‘Hibernate’.
